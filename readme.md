Linux, Windows and Mac binary builds of my Brainfuck IDE made in Godot

The entire project is open source here: [https://github.com/william01110111/BrainfuckIDE](https://github.com/william01110111/BrainfuckIDE)

The interface is designed to be intuitive. Play around and you'll figure it out.

If you have a problem or want a feature, open an issue on the projects main repo (linked above). This project isn't my top priority at the moment but I'll see what I can do.
